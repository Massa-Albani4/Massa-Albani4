### Hi, I'm Massa!

Freelance Frontend Developer focused on clean UI,
responsive design, and performance.


Interests:
- Web development & UI/UX
- Cybersecurity (offensive security path)
- Music production
- Combat sports


I prioritize clean structure, scalability, and interfaces that are intuitive and efficient, not just usable.

I'm constantly learning and shipping real work.
